# Airbnb experience clone
The main goal of this project is to create a clone of Airbnb experience in order to reinforce my knowledge about how the front communicate with backend.

The server of this project is a json file (located in src/db/data-cards.json)  and  JSON server.
    
 ## How to run this project in develop mode
 In your terminal run `npm start` and `npm run mock`.

### OBS:
The command `npm run mock` is used to run json server.

 ## JSON Server
 It is used to create a fake REST API with zero coding.

## Improvements
I tried to create a node server in order to create a full stack project. 
You can run the command `node server`to run the backend.
